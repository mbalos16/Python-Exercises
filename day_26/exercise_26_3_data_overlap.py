# Exercise 26.3. Data overlap

# Instructions: 
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.
# IMPORTANT: The result should be a list that contains Integers, not Strings. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
