# Exercise 26.2. Filtering even numbers

# Instructions: 
# You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called result. This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers.
# DO NOT modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

import pandas as pd

numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ğŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above

#Write your 1 line code ğŸ‘‡ below:

# result = [new_item for item in list if test]
result = [num for num in numbers if num%2 == 0]

#Write your code ğŸ‘† above:

print(result)
