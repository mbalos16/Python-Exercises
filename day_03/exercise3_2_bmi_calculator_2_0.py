# Exercise 3.2 - BMI calculator 2.0

# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
#     Under 18.5 they are underweight
#     Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
#     Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
#     Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
#     Above 35 they are clinically obese.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bmi = float(weight) / float(height) ** 2
bmi = round(bmi)

# Same code with bold names integrated in the code
# class color:
#    BOLD = '\033[1m'
#    END = '\033[0m'
