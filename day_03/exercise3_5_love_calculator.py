# Exercise 3.5 - Love calculator

# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
# To work out the love score between two people:
#     Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
#     Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
#     Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
# "Your score is **z**."


# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")

name2 = input("What is their name? \n")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
names_together = name1.lower() + name2.lower()
# print(names_together)

    print(f"Your score is {score}, you are alright together.")
else:
